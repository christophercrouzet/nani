API Reference
=============

The whole public interface of Nani is described here.

All of the library's content is accessible from within the only module
``nani``. This includes the types required to define a NumPy ``dtype``, the
field helpers when dealing with structured arrays, the functions, and the final
output structure :class:`Nani` returned from the main routine :func:`resolve`.
